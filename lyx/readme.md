# LyX files

This directory contains the necessary layout files to use the UGent packages with Lyx.

## Installation

1. Find your user folder of LyX. Go to `Help` > `About`. The path to your user folder should be listed there. For example, for Windows users using Lyx 2.3, it is: `%AppData%\LyX2.3`.
2. Copy the `*.layout` and `*.inc` files from this folder to the `layouts` folder, i.e. `%AppData%\LyX2.3\layouts`.
3. Refresh LyX: `Extra` > `Reset`.
4. You can now select the classes from the document settings.
