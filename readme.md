# UGent2016 styles

Provides document classes and packages to create documents in the official 2016 Ghent University style.
The document classes are easy to use, but most functionality is also available as package for use with custom document classes.

These packages/classes require fontspec (only tested with LuaLatex).

## Warning

The packages are still in beta! Please report issues.

## Use

See the included documentation (in Dutch for now).

## Compiling documentation

The files in the `/frontpages` map should be compiled to pdf. Then, simply compile the docnl.tex as you would any other document.
