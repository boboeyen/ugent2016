# The UGent2016 packages

Version: 0.2   
Date: 2019/06/12

## Description

Unofficial packages to create documents in the official Ghent University style. Three document classes are provided that work out of the box:

- `ugent2016-article`
- `ugent2016-book`
- `ugent2016-report`

These classes use the KOMA-Script classes behind the scenes. Most of the functionality (assets and front pages) are also available as separate packages for use with other document classes.

## Maintenance

The package is maintained at https://github.com/niknetniko/ugent2016. Issues can also be reported there.
Current maintainer(s):

- Niko Strijbol <strijbol.niko@gmail.com>

## Installation

1. Install the current version with the preferred package manager of your TeX distribution. A tds-zip file is available from the source repository.
2. Development versions might be available in the source repository. A makefile to produce tds compatible zips is also available.
3. Manual installation details:
    - Install all `*.cls` and `*.sty` files under `tex/latex/ugent2016`.
    - Copy the `/logos` directory to `tex/latex/ugent2016`. The result should be `tex/latex/ugent2016/logos/*`.
    - Copy `ugent2016-nl.pdf` and `ugent2016-en.pdf` to `doc/latex/ugent2016`.
    - Copy `ugent2016-nl.tex` and `ugent2016-en.tex` to `source/latex/ugent2016`.
    - Copy `ugent2016-title-*.tex` to `source/latex/ugent2016`. These are some source files needed for the documentation and can also server as an example.
